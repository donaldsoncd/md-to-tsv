# Known Issues

If your critical edition uses more than one footnote marker per line (e.g., `A line of text[^1] with two note markers[^2]`) than program will cut off the text following the first footnote marker.

You can resolve this manually if you do not have too many lines with multiple footnotes or you can prepare your text beforehand.

Alternatively, do not use more than one footnote per line.
